So, I still haven''t been able to work on my game because of the work load in my classes. I literally have three computer science projects due on the same day ;-;. Plus, since I am a poor exam taker, that doesn't help my situation either since I have to spend a lot of time studying just to have a chance. Despite the stress, I was able to do a bit with my game. The one big thing I did was switch my platform! Again! Now I am using Game Maker Studio on Steam. It has made developing significantly faster. I'm usually very picky and skeptical to most engines, but this is pretty lightweight for an engine and it is made how I would make it, so it works for me. Still, the game has not really advanced yet in content.
