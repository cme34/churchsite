So, as of this first post, I already have a lot done. I have first set of sprites of the main character finished. I plan to add more detail to her in the future since she is quite bland, but for now I am satisfied with it. Currently I have the game able to have basic rooms and be able to transition between them, as well as have Sarah able to walk, run, jump, and crouch (and crouch slide for a bit...). Sadly, I ran into a problem writing the game that is caused by the language itself, so I will need to transition the game over to C++ from Java. This processes shouldn't take to long, but progress will be halted for a bit.
